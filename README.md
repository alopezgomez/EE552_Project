University of Washington EE 552 Power System Dynamics Project

Time-domain simulation of multi-machine stability. The analysis ensures that following a large disturbance, the synchronous generators remain in synchronism.

The second-order classical model of the synchronous generator is used to simulate the rotor dynamics of the generators. Likewise, the third-order model described by Machowski et al. is used to enhance the simulation results obtained with the second-order model. Finally, the third-order model is used to study the influence of the following factors :
Fault clearing time
Damping

The code is divided into four sections:

1. Reading data and defining simulation parameters
2. Power flow solution
3. Second-order model 
4. Third-order model
