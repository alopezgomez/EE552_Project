Time-domain simulation of rotor dynamics of a multi-machine power system when a fault occurs.
The analysis ensures that following a large disturbance the synchronous generators remain in synchronism.

The solution is found using the second order classical model of the synchronous generator and the third order model described in the book by Machowski et al.
